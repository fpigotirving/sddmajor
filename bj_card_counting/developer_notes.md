# Developer Notes #

### Wednesday, 5 June ###
Today marked the beginning of work on my project, and I started by creating the main menu. This is a crucial part of the project as it sets the stage for user interaction. The main menu needs to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to navigate easily to various sections such as settings, the main app screen, and more. I focused on ensuring that the design was clean and that the buttons were clearly labelled to avoid any confusion. This initial step is vital as it lays the foundation for the entire user experience.

### Sunday, 9 June ###
By this time, significant progress had been made. I completed the settings menu and the configuration file, both of which are essential for the functionality of the programme. The settings menu allows users to customise their gaming experience, which includes adjusting visual and audio preferences, setting app rules, and other personalisations. The configuration file, on the other hand, is critical as it stores all these settings, ensuring that the user's preferences are saved and applied every time they use the application. Following this, I began developing the main app screen and started implementing the card counting system. The main app screen is where the core app function occurs, so it needed to be both visually appealing and functionally robust.

### Wednesday, 12 June ###
Today, I finalised the main app screen, integrating it seamlessly with the rest of the program. Completing the main app screen was a significant milestone, as it required careful planning and execution to ensure that all elements were correctly displayed and that the user interface was responsive. Additionally, I finished developing the core of the card counting system. This system is designed to track the distribution of cards dealt and assist players in making informed decisions. However, there are still a few critical features that need to be added: the probability of winning calculations, the true count of the deck, and the save function. These features will enhance the strategic aspect of the app, providing players with valuable insights and the ability to save and resume their progress.

Emailed stakeholders to inform them of the progress of the project.
### Wednesday, 19 June ###
At this stage, the project is nearly complete. Over the next few days, I will focus on thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs. Testing is a crucial phase as it ensures that the application runs smoothly and that all features work as intended. I will conduct various test scenarios to cover different aspects of the app, from user interface interactions to the accuracy of the card counting algorithm. Additionally, I will add finishing touches, such as polishing the user interface and ensuring that all elements are cohesive. Tomorrow, I will begin working on my Part B documentation, which will provide a detailed overview of the project, including design decisions, implementation details, and user instructions.

Allowed a small group of stakeholders to beta test the application and provide feedback.

### Friday, 21 June ###
Today, I completed the final touches on the project and conducted a final round of testing. The application is now ready for deployment. I fixed minor bugs and optimised the performance to ensure a smooth user experience. With everything in place, I am ready to commit the project to GitHub. This marks the completion of the development phase, and I feel confident that the application meets all the objectives set out at the beginning. The documentation is also complete, providing users with a comprehensive guide to using the application and understanding its features. Committing the project to GitHub not only provides a backup but also allows for version control and future updates. I am excited to share this project with others and receive feedback on my work.
