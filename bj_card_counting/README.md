This program is designed to allow the user to determine the optimal moves for a Blackjack game, essentially by using a more complicated version the Hi-Lo card counting system.

The program will also output the current count of the deck, and the true count of the deck. The program will also output the probability of the user winning the game, based on the current count of the deck.

## How to Use
Click New Game. Select the number of players, as well as your position relative to the other players. Click Start Game. Enter the cards in your hand, as well as the dealer's hand, and the other players. Click "Calculate Best Move". The program will output the optimal move for you to make.

## Configure options
Under the Options menu, there are options you can configure. You can change a number of variable blackjack rules, based on the rules of the table you are playing at. Doing so is important to ensure the program is accurate in its calculations. 

## Query
